# Design Tasks for Short Story Game

## 1. Narrative Design
- [ ] Define overall story outline and flow
- [ ] Write dialog, narration, and instructions for each beat
- [ ] Identify player objectives, win/lose conditions, and branching (if any)

## 2. Game Structure & Flow
- [x] Implement a story-state machine (init, beat1, beat2, ..., win, restart)
- [x] Define trigger zones (coordinates and radii) for each story beat
- [x] Create functions to lock/unlock controls and show/hide overlays
- [ ] Handle restart logic and reset player state

## 3. Environment & Assets
- [x] Replace the simple GridHelper with custom level geometry or terrain
- [x] Model and import low-poly assets (e.g., a glowing orb, portal, props)
- [ ] Unwrap, texture, and UV map all 3D assets
- [x] Position and scale assets to align with trigger zones

## 4. Player Controls & Mechanics
- [ ] Fine-tune camera FOV, movement speed, jump strength, and gravity
- [x] Add collision detection with imported level geometry
- [ ] Optionally add sprint, crouch, or other movement modes
- [ ] Implement a pause menu and instructions overlay

## 5. UI & User Experience
- [x] Design a responsive story overlay panel (CSS styling + animations)
- [ ] Implement click-to-continue logic in the overlay
- [x] Add HUD elements (e.g., objectives list, progress bar)
- [ ] Create victory and game-over screens with replay options

## 6. Audio & Sound Effects
- [ ] Choose or compose background music
- [ ] Add ambient sounds (wind, footsteps, UI clicks)
- [ ] Add audio cues for each story event or trigger
- [ ] Implement volume controls and audio mixer

## 7. Visual Effects & Polishing
- [x] Add dynamic lighting (spotlights, point lights at triggers)
- [x] Implement particle effects (e.g., orb glow, portal particles)
- [ ] Apply post-processing (bloom, color grading, tone mapping)
- [ ] Animate UI transitions and typewriter text effects

## 8. Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Optimize geometry and textures for web delivery
- [ ] Implement Level-of-Detail (LOD) or lazy-loading for assets
- [ ] Test and maintain stable frame rates on target devices
- [ ] Minify and bundle scripts and assets

## 9. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test controls and story triggers on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Validate that all trigger zones fire at correct locations
- [ ] Test restart, win, and edge-case scenarios
- [ ] Fix bugs, handle errors, and add user feedback

## 10. Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Write a README with game overview, controls, and setup
- [ ] Comment and document major code modules and flows
- [ ] Create a build script or bundler config (e.g., webpack)
- [ ] Deploy to hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages) and verify online build

## 11. Portal System Implementation
- [x] Create portal objects with distinctive visual styling
- [x] Implement portal collision detection for teleportation
- [x] Design multiple world environments with unique characteristics
- [x] Add particle effects to portals for visual feedback
- [ ] Add sound effects for portal entry/exit
- [ ] Implement smooth transition effects when changing worlds
